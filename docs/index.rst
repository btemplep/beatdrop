Welcome to beatdrop's documentation!
====================================

The goal of `beatdrop` is to provide easy to use schedulers and schedule entries that are extensible, scalable, and backend agnostic. 

It **does not** run tasks or python functions on a schedule. It will simply interface with task backends to send tasks when they are due.
